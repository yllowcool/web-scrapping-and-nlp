term
hi
guys
im
back
from
my
korea
trip
with
my
brother
its
my
second
time
in
seoul
the
last
time
i
visited
seoul
was
last
year
may
and
to
be
honest
i
still
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
city
this
time
around
i
didnt
go
to
a
lot
of
tourist
spots
like
how
i
did
during
my
first
korea
trip
so
if
you
havent
been
to
seoul
and
are
looking
for
a
seoul
travel
itinerary
tips
for
first
timers
you
can
read
my
korea
travel
guide
which
i
wrote
last
year
ok
if
you
are
following
my
instagram
you
would
have
probably
already
seen
my
pictures
with
my
boyfriend
which
i
havent
really
shared
announced
on
my
blog
i
am
not
sure
if
you
guys
could
remember
but
my
previous
blog
post
"the
last
hug"
was
actually
about
him
just
to
clear
off
some
of
your
doubts
my
boyfriend
is
not
a
korean
oppa
lolol
he
is
a
dutch
chinese
from
netherlands
and
we
knew
each
other
from
the
company
that
i
interned
at
he
is
currently
studying
in
korea
as
an
exchange
student
until
june
so
i
just
thought
why
not
i
make
a
trip
to
korea
to
visit
him
and
its
also
just
in
time
to
catch
the
cherry
blossoms
in
seoul
too
and
i
tagged
my
brother
along
too
so
that
he
can
be
our
personal
photographer
hahahaha
during
my
recent
trip
to
seoul
2nd
april
10th
april
i
revisited
some
of
my
favourite
places
and
also
discovered
some
new
hipster
cafes
and
i
also
went
to
both
lotte
world
and
everland
this
time
hahaha

never

throughout
our
trip
its
a
newly
opened
budget
hotel
which
is
located
in
the
vicinity
of
dongdaemun
the
nearest
subway
station
dongmyo
is
just
7
mins
walk
away
which
is
the
main
reason
why
we
chose
this
hotel
there
are
also
2
convenience
stores
and
quite
a
lot
of
restaurants
for
example
kyochon
chicken
nearby
our
hotel
our
room
is
clean
and
cozy
and
theres
free
wifi
we
definitely
enjoyed
our
stay
there
it
just
feels
like
a

there
are
also
some
empty
spaces
beside

so
that
you
can
put
your
luggage
and
shopping
bags
i
would
say
that
this
room
is
just
enough
for
me
and
my
brother
toilet
is
really
new
and
clean

we
went

this
beautiful
cafe
vant

5
menon
in
hongdae
when
you
try
to
be
candid
but
end
up
laughing
because
you
think
you
are
being
too
pretentious
a
warm
cup
of
coffee
was
just
perfect
for
the
chilly
and
windy
weather
korean
bbq
for
dinner
there
are
quite
a
lot
of
korean
bbq
restaurants
in
hongdae
so
we
just
randomly
went
into
one
and
kyochon
chicken
as
supper
this
restaurant
is
just
located
near
our
hotel
day
2
we
went
to
dongdaemun
design
plaza
in
the
morning
to
take
some
pictures
in
the
afternoon
we
went
to
garosugil
to
cafe
hop
and
shop
there
are
tons
of
cool
cafes
in
garosugil
and
its
just
virtually
impossible
for
us
to
try
everyone
of
them
so
we
decided
to
go
for
cafe
mula
which
is
a
cafe
with
a
minimalistic
vibe

to
go

we
took
the
