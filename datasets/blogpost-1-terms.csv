incheon
international
airport
near
seoul
arriving
and
leaving
seoul
there
are
a
number
of
ways
you
could
enter
seoul
but
likely
if
you
take
an
international
flight
from
a
different
country
youll
land
at
incheon
international
airport
incheon
international
airport
incheon
international
airport
is
a
giant
airport
that
caters
to
basically
the
entire
northern
part
of
south
korea
and
is
located
approximately
1
hour
by
train
from
the
center
of
seoul
the
airport
is
very
nice
and
modern
with
easy
transportation
facilities
and
theres
free
wifi
as
well
ive
even
spent
the
night
at
seoul
incheon
airport
before
and
its
a
pretty
decent
place
to
spend
the
night
if
you
need
to
getting
from
the
airport
to
seoul
the
easiest
way
to
get
from
the
airport
to
the
center
of
seoul
is
by
train
once
you
get
out
of
customs
follow
the
signs
for
the
airport
railroad
and
youll
have
to
cross
over
the
road
either
over
or
on
ground
and
get
to
the
adjacent
building
which
is
the
train
station
there
are
a
couple
different
options
express
train
this
is
the
faster
high
speed
train
that
goes
directly
from
incheon
airport
to
seoul
station
and
if
you
want
to
make
sure
you
have
a
seat
or
if
you
have
a
lot
of
baggage
this
might
be
the
best
option
it
takes
about
43
minutes
and
the
price
is
14
800
won
$12
62
per
person
seoul
metro
ive
never
taken
the
express
train
because
the
metro
goes
the
same
route
only
take
a
few
minutes
longer
and
costs
much
less
but
it
does
stop
at
11
different
stations
along
the
way
and
it
can
be
busy
so
you
may
need
to
stand
it
takes
about
56
minutes
and
costs
3
250
won
$2

transportation
section
of
this
guide
for
more
information
about
buying
subway
tickets
and
getting
around
seoul
visa
no
visa
required
another
wonderful
thing
about
visiting
south
korea
is
that
for
many
nationalities
getting
a
90
day
or
30
day
stamp
on
arrival
is
a
breeze
however
make
sure
you
do
your
own
research
for
your
own
nationality
if
you
qualify
all
you
have
to
do
is
fill
out
the
small
entry
card
which
youll
be
given
on
your
flight
fly
into
incheon
international
airport
go
through
immigration
and
theyll
stamp
you
into
south
korea
alright
now
youre
in
seoul
taking
the
train
around
south
korea
if
youre
traveling
onwards
from
seoul
to
other
parts
of
south
korea
taking
the
train
is
one
of
the
most
convenient
ways
to
get
around
many
trains
to
other
parts
of
south
korea
leave
from
either
seoul
station
yongsan
station
or
cheongnyangni
station
its
recommended
to
book
your
train
tickets
a
few
days
ahead
of
time
so
you
can
confirm
that
youll
have
a
seat
from
seoul
my
wife
and
i
traveled
to
the
food
paradise
of
jeonju
and
we
pre
booked
out
ticket
the
day
before
we
left
heres
some
information
to
help
you
choose
where
you
stay
where
to
stay
in
seoul
seoul
is
a
huge
city
and
there
are
many
different
areas
to
stay
in
depending
on
your
interests
however
what
i
noticed
about
places
to
stay
in
seoul
is
because
the
public
transportation
system
is
so
efficient
and
convenient
to
use
its
not
hugely
important
which
area
you
stay
in
as
long
as
youre
somewhat
central
because
you
can
always
get
to
where
you
need
to
go
seoul
has
nearly
every
form
of
accommodation
available
from
modern
hostels
to
major
5
star
hotel
brands
prices
for
accommodation
are
overall
quite
high
but
you
do
have
plenty
of
options
in
this
seoul
travel
blog
guide
im
going
to
share
a
few
of
the
main
areas
that
you
should
consider
and
why
jung
gu
and
jongno
gu
these
two
districts
are
what
i
would
call
the
most
central
to
seoul
sightseeing
and
shopping
and
right
in
the
heart
of
the
downtown
area
of
seoul
youll
find
many
hotels
in
this
area
and
its
a
great
area
to
stay
if
you
want
easy
access
to
the
famous
attractions
without
spending
much
time
on
the
metro
myeongdong
myeondong
is
one
of
the
biggest
shopping
districts
in
seoul
and
its
home
to
lots
of
restaurants
hotels
and
trendy
fashion
and
nightlife
stay
in
myeongdong
to
be
surrounded
by
shopping
seoul
station
yongsan
gu
the
area
around
seoul
station
is
huge
and
youll
find
both
high
end
and
lower
end
hotels
theres
not
so
much
to
do
or
see
right
at
seoul
station
although
its
very
close
to
namdaemun
market
and
myeondong
but
its
convenient
for
transportation
hongdae
hongik
university
hongdae
is
located
in
western
seoul
and
its
known
especially
for
being
a
university
town
and
therefore
theres
plenty
of
shopping
restaurants
street
food
and
nightlife
its
overall
a
great
local
area
of
seoul
and
a
fun
area
to
walk
around
and
explore
there
are
lots
of
guest
houses
in
this
area
so
its
a
good
place
to
looks
for
budget
to
mid
range
accommodation
gangnam
gu
finally
theres
gangnam
which
is
an
area
of
seoul
that
is
known
for
being
high
end
and
very
trendy
there
are
some
very
fancy
and
upscale
hotels
in
this
area
where
did
i
stay
airbnb
rental
<
use
that
link
for
a

ive
stayed
at
a
number
of
hotels
in
seoul
but
on
my
latest
trip
when
my
wife
and
i
were
writing
this
seoul
travel
guide
we
stayed
at
a
rental
apartment
near
seoul
station
i
think
an
apartment
rental
works
quite
well
in
seoul
especially
if
youre
traveling
with
a
group
of
friends
or
family
so
you
can
all
be
together
and
get
a
pretty
decent
deal
phil
house
i
also
stayed
at
phil
house
a
small
and
friendly
hotel
thats
clean
and
modern
the
only
problem
is
that
its
located
a
little
far
from
central
seoul
but
close
to
the
subway
station
but
its
usually
a
pretty
good
price
